# My journey

I am not a "developer" in the narrow sense. I am first an engineer, and my path started in AI.

My early work combined software development and applied research: I coded algorithms for speech processing ([Sirocco](https://www.afcp-parole.org/doc/Archives_JEP/2002_XXIVe_JEP_Nancy/JEP2002/papiers/131.pdf)) or for building training corpora ([Transcriber](https://trans.sourceforge.net/)).

Around 2008, when Google and Apple started capturing most of the industrial AI momentum, I shifted toward broader IT roles.

From 2016 onward, I moved back more deeply into AI and innovative software development, especially around public services. Since then, I have continued coding regularly, in parallel with governance, management, architecture, and program leadership responsibilities.

My anchor remains software engineering and technology consulting. My conviction is straightforward: we are not leaving engineering, we are leaving the era of central manual coding, just as we left the assembler era. The value is moving toward intent and architecture, while maintaining the demands of convergence quality and long-term robustness.
