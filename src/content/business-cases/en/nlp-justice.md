The Court of Cassation wanted to release court decisions after anonymization. Following an Etalab challenge, a FlairNLP/PyTorch model was implemented to detect 19 types of identifying entities, and software was built to accelerate anonymization validation. The DevOps and MLOps system was industrialized on a dual Kubernetes architecture (private and public cloud), with an API exposed to legaltech players and other reusers.
