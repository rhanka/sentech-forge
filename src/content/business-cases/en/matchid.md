Creation and industrialization of an open source fuzzy data matching engine. MatchID enables searches across databases containing millions of records with error correction. Notably used for the deceased persons search engine (INSEE dataset, 5K daily users), it processes 10M queries per month and serves as a reference for data matching in France.
