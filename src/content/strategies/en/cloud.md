# Sovereign Cloud

## Platform Engineering • IaaS • CaaS •  PaaS • RFI • RFP

The Ministry of Defense wanted to accelerate sovereign cloud acquisition for dual-use missions. Defense forces and technology leaders set the strategy, reviewed partnership opportunities, and briefed stakeholders on key technologies (Platform Engineering, IaaS, CaaS, PaaS). They then cataloged capacity needs by use case and assessed vendor compliance (RFI) ahead of the RFP.
